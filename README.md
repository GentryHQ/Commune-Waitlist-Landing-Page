## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Set hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Build a responsive navigation that works on screen size
- Hide the image on smaller screens.

## My Process

### Built With
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

- I really learnt how to be more patient with myself and my code. After writing the Javascript for the toggle function for smaller screens, the code didn't work. I did all the debugging I could but I couldn't get it to work. It took me about a week to find out in JS file while referencing some HTML element I actually misspelt `getElementById` as `getElement*s*ById`. What a subtle mistake!

- While debugging why Nav toggle wasn't working, I learnt different method to make a nav work.

### Continued development

I actually will be doing more with Javascript in the future.
